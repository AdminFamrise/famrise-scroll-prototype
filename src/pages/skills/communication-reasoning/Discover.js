            A parent explodes over spilled milk â€” but then takes a deep breath, names
            their emotion, and models a calm, constructive response. This everyday
            moment becomes a learning opportunity, showing how tone and word choice
            can diffuse tension and foster understanding.

            <strong>Communication:</strong> Not just grammar or vocabulary, but
            also tone, timing, body cues, and emotional awareness â€” so you can
            connect better with others and avoid unnecessary conflict.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Evaluating information and options before
            responding, so youâ€™re not reacting purely on emotion, but making
            choices that serve your goals and relationships.
